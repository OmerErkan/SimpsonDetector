SimpsonDetector
===============
This beta application was written in short period of time and is part of a paper presented at PUC Minas to the discipline of Digital Image Processing.

The paper proposed the study and implementation of computer vision techniques and application in Android. We then proposed a method using SURF, KNN and parallel processing. The program was relatively efficient in several tests, but due to the fact the characters seem too had to leave the algorithm insensitive, what hampered detection in various situations.
The failures show that there is viable for future study and research and to improve intuited and propose new solutions.

Works with Homer, Marge and Otto.
